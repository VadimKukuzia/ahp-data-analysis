# **Results Processing Notebooks**  

## **Overview**  
The notebook files contain visualization results for the derived priority vectors:  
- Individually for each scenario and factor type  
- Aggregated by factor type across all scenarios for convenience

These visualizations facilitate both expert-driven manual analysis and algorithmic machine-assisted analysis.  

## **Results**  

### **Scenario-Specific Analysis**  
The graphs below present the results of obtaining the priority vectors, translated into percentages for clarity. The analysis is conducted both manually (expert assessment) and automatically (algorithmic processing) for each factor group (economic, social, environmental) and for each scenario:  
- **Blast explosion with shockwave**  
- **Fire**  
- **Fireball**  

Additionally, correlation analysis is performed to compare manual and machine-generated rankings.

### **Aggregated Scenario Analysis**  
The graphs below show the priority vectors translated into percentages for clarity. This analysis aggregates results across scenarios within each factor group (economic, social, environmental), providing a broader perspective:  
- **Explosion with blast wave**  
- **Fire**  
- **Fireball**  

This aggregation helps in understanding overall trends across different emergency scenarios.
